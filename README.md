# House_Sale_Price
There are 2 folders in our submission.

-Deliverable is our main report and the delivery. -"code" folder contains our code in R or Python. They are named by order and the topic correspond to our report.

Note that we output csv "train_cleaned.csv" for further analysis after we've finish data cleaning.

-"original" folder contains the original dataset "train.csv" and a texted description to help you understand our dataset.

If you have any question about our project, please contact: Rio Wei, riowei2018@gmail.com Thank you.
